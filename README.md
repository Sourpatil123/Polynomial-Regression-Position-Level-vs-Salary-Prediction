# Polynomial-Regression-Position-Level-vs-Salary-Prediction

📘 Overview

This project demonstrates how Polynomial Regression can be used to predict employee salaries based on their position level within a company. Unlike simple linear regression, which fits a straight line, polynomial regression captures non-linear relationships between variables — giving more accurate predictions when data shows curves or trends.

🎯 Objective

To build a regression model that predicts an employee’s salary using the position level as input by applying Polynomial Regression and comparing it with Linear Regression results.

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains two columns:
| Column Name | Description                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `Level`     | Position level (1–10)                  |
| `Salary`    | Corresponding salary for that position |

Example Data
| Level | Salary  |
| ----- | ------- |
| 1     | 45000   |
| 2     | 50000   |
| 3     | 60000   |
| 4     | 80000   |
| 5     | 110000  |
| 6     | 150000  |
| 7     | 200000  |
| 8     | 300000  |
| 9     | 500000  |
| 10    | 1000000 |
